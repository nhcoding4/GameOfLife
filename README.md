 Trying to see how much I can push performance on game of life with my current level of programming skill. This sees a ~-600%-~ ~-900%-~ ~>1000%~ 2400% performance uplift compared to my old version. 

# What is Conway's Game Of Life?
It's a simple automata simulation that enacts 3 simple rules on a grid of 'cells'.
1. If a cell has 3 alive neighbours it comes alive.
2. If a cell has exactly 2 alive neighbours its status remains the same.
3. All other conditions mean the cell dies / remains dead.

# Changes made since I started programming.
This was on of the first real program's I ever made (around Dec 2023). Since then it has seen the following changes:

Don't do stupid OOP related stuff and just type it out like a normal person
