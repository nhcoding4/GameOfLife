 Trying to see how much I can push performance on game of life with my current level of programming skill. Started off getting around 10fps on a 1920 x 1080 grid (cell size = 2 px). Up to around 110-140fps on a grid double the size(on the same machine). 

# What is Conway's Game Of Life?
It's a simple automata simulation that enacts 3 simple rules on a grid of 'cells'.
1. If a cell has 3 alive neighbours it comes alive.
2. If a cell has exactly 2 alive neighbours its status remains the same.
3. All other conditions mean the cell dies / remains dead.
